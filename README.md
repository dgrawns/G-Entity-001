# G-Entity-001

My personal take on making something close to the Entities in Backrooms, but with its own uniqueness.



LORE:

G-Entity 001 appears to be a slow-moving humanoid figure that stalks its prey for prolonged periods of time. It may appear unharmful at first, in fact sometimes it won't harm you, but there have been cases of people being killed upon touch, so exercise caution if you are unfortunate enough to be near it.


KNOWN ABILITIES:
Inhuman speeds recorded at times.
Strange movement patterns, it often seems as though it's always waiting ahead of you.
Superhuman strength observed in victim footage.
Distorted view?

MAP RECOMMENDATION!

I'm honestly not entirely sure on this but you're probably better off to have a nav meshed map as a precaution.

Also as another tid bit, I highly recommend using maps that are closed-quarters with no big open areas.

The one I used in photos and videos:

Fair warning: If you delete the nextbot while on-screen effects are active, they might get stuck on and may require either rejoining or restarting map.

Thanks and hope you enjoy! I will probably be updating this while also maybe making others.
